                    <div class="title">Hypothesis Testing</div>
                    In statistics, people often want to know if there is a correlation between two or more variables in the data they are observing. Hypotheses are made to make claims about the data, and the null hypothesis says that there is no correlation. Hypothesis tests are performed to test the validity of that claim. The curve to the right represents the distribution of all possible results versus the probablity that they'll be observed.

                    <div class="title">What is a p-value?</div>
                    A p-value is the probability that you would observe a result given that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, the probability of getting your results by chance. A large p-value means that there is little evidence against the null hypothesis, so you the result is you fail to reject it, meaning the correlation for the variables observed is not statistically significant. A small p-value means that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so the result is you reject it, meaning the observed correlation is statistically significant. A p-value of 0.05 is the common cutoff for significance, which is shown by the red line on the graph to the right.

                    <div class="title">What is p-hacking?</div>
                    P-hacking is a way of manipulating the data to uncover patterns in the data that have a p-value less than 0.05. If the p-value for your data is above 0.05 that means that the results are more likely to have occured by chance and therefore your findings are not publishable. However, there are ways to manipulate your data to get the p-value below 0.05. Some of these methods include only reporting measures with p < 0.05, excluding participants, and transforming the data to fit your needs. Researchers may be incentivized to p-hack to make their findings publishable because they put a lot of time and money into their work. Out of all the possible results represented in the distribution to the right, the shaded red area shows observations with a p-value of less than 0.05, which are the only results that are publishable.

                    <div class="title">Is there a relationship in this data?</div>
                    This scatterplot shows two variables plotted against each other for a number of observations. You might be interested in whether or not there is a correlation between the two variables. It looks like there might be a relationship between the two variables, but how do you know if the correlation is real?

                <section class="step">
                    This line shows the relationship between the two variables for the whole data set. This p-value represents the probability that you would get results as strong as this without there being a real correlation between these two variables.

                    When researchers manipulate their data for the purpose of p-hacking, it makes their results harder to reproduce, especially if they are not upfront about the all the variables or they used or the transformations they performed on the data to get their results. P-hacking also makes the findings less reliable because biases can have an effect on the results.
